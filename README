You need to install some number of fedora 20+ or RHEL machines.  Doesn't matter how
or where or whatever.  Real hardware, VMs, honey badger don't care.

Record the IP address of which machine you want to be your master
Record the IP address of the machine you want to be your etcd server
Record the IP addresses of the machines you want to be your minions.

Decide what /24 network each one of your minions should use to expose pods.  You
need a /24 for EACH minion.

Stick that information into the 'inventory' file.

The network ranges you picked above go in their respective kube_ip_addr= vars.

You can use this to deploy your public key to all the nodes.  Just put the root
pword for all nodes in ~/rootpassword and make sure you have sshpass installed.
See the comments in keys.yml to explain the failing ping and offer some other
options.

# To accept the ssh host key and put your ssh pub key on the nodes:
ansible-playbook -i inventory ping.yml # This will look like it fails, that's ok
ansible-playbook -i inventory keys.yml

# To create a hacked up set up using static networking:
ansible-playbook -i inventory hack-network.yml

# Set up the actual clust
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml

Which should set up the one master and an unlimited number of RHEL7,
F20, F21, or rawhide.

HORRIFIC_HACK: disable gpg checking on all repos since f21 isn't signed
HORRIFIC_HACK: ignore errors enabling the copr repo, since it works
SHOULD_BE_REMOVED: All code pertaining to support for kube before the scheduler
		Namely the controller-manager config file and the conditional
		enable/restart sections
