You need to install some number of fedora 20+ or RHEL machines.  Doesn't matter how
or where or whatever.  Real hardware, VMs, honey badger don't care.

Record the IP address of which machine you want to be your master
Record the IP address of the machine you want to be your etcd server
Record the IP addresses of the machines you want to be your minions.

Decide what /24 network each one of your minions should use to expose pods.  You
need a /24 for EACH minion.

Stick that information into the 'inventory' file.

The network ranges you picked above go in their respective kube_ip_addr= vars.

You can use this to deploy your public key to all the nodes.  Just put the root
pword for all nodes in ~/rootpassword and make sure you have sshpass installed.
See the comments in keys.yml to explain the failing ping and offer some other
options.

Then just run:
ansible-playbook -i inventory ping.yml # This will look like it fails, that's ok
ansible-playbook -i inventory keys.yml

After the keys are laid down you can do:
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml

Which should set up etcd, the master, and the minion nodes.
