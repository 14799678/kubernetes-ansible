YOU NEED TO CONFIGURE TWO FILES.

inventory
group_vars/all.yml

I hope to one day get rid of the need to do anything in group_vars/all.yml
but for now, it basically the same info you put into the inventory file.

Then just run:
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml

and you'll have a running kubernetes cluster!
