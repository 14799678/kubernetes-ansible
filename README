You need to install some number of fedora 21+ machines.  Doesn't matter how
or where or whatever.  Real hardware, VMs, honey badger don't care.

Record the IP address of which machine you want to be your master
Records the IP address of the machines you want to be your minions.

Stick that information into the two config files.  It should be obvious.

inventory
group_vars/all.yml

I hope to one day get rid of the need to do anything in group_vars/all.yml
but for now, it basically the same info you put into the inventory file.

You can use this to deploy your public key to all the nodes.  Just put the root
pword for all nodes in ~/rootpassword and make sure you have sshpass installed.

Then just run:
ansible-playbook -i inventory keys.yml

See the comments in keys.yml if you want to deliver keys entering the pword on
the command line instead of by puting it in a file on the fs.

After the keys are laid down you can do:
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml

Which should set up etcd, the master, and the minion nodes.

Aug 15, 2014 DNF in Fedora is broken.  The first time you run the playbook it
will tell you that dnf failed and stop running.  Have no fear.  Just run the
playbook again.  dnf actually worked, and since ansible modules are
idempotent, there is no harm in doing it again (and again and again)
