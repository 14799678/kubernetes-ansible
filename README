You need to install some number of fedora 21+ machines.  Doesn't matter how
or where or whatever.  Real hardware, VMs, honey badger don't care.

Record the IP address of which machine you want to be your master
Record the IP address of the machine you want to be your etcd server
Records the IP address of the machines you want to be your minions.

Stick that information into the 'inventory' file

You can use this to deploy your public key to all the nodes.  Just put the root
pword for all nodes in ~/rootpassword and make sure you have sshpass installed.
See the comments in keys.yml to explain the failing ping and offer some other
options.

Then just run:
ansible-playbook -i inventory ping.yml # This will look like it fails, that's ok
ansible-playbook -i inventory keys.yml

After the keys are laid down you can do:
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml

Which should set up etcd, the master, and the minion nodes.
